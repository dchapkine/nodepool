nodepool
===

### Description


Nodepool is nodejs + npm + nodeinspector distribution for windows 7. Its goal is to speed up development of nodejs applications on windows.

Think of it as the [wamp](http://wampserver.com/en/) or [xampp](http://www.apachefriends.org/fr/xampp.html) distribution but for nodejs app development.

NodePool is NOT a text editor/ide but plays nice with any text editor/ide.
